Background:
During Chalmers’ reception in the fall, the reception committé MK is responsible for coordinating the bookings of the various reception committés from the different student divisions. This is to prevent different committees from booking the same location at the same time. Currently, the system for handling locations which cannot be booked through a central booking system, like through the Student union, is not handled very well. The different committees all fill in a giant excel sheet for the location they wish to book at a certain time. It is very hard to get an overview of the bookings, and since anyone is able to edit the document, there have been several instances where one division uses a certain name for a location while another committee uses another name to book it. Overall, the process creates a lot of administrative work for MK and often leads to confusion.

Project Scope:
We will create a website in which the users (NollK:n) easily can see which premises can be booked, and which time slots are available. You can see the booked time slots for each location, and who have booked them. If there is an empty time slot you as a NollK can book it. Certain locations go by first-come-first-serve, and other locations users can only request a booked time slot, which later have to be approved by MK. What principle a location follows is also decided by MK. MK can also override bookings and add more locations if they want to.
