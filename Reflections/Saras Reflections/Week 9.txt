what do I want to learn or understand better?
A. 
Right now I mostly only know the things that I've done but not the actual
code parts of the others work

B.
I want to fully know how the whole application works and it's function

C.
Looking through the files and make notes of what is connected to what and
how it functions


how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A.
As I had big problems changing the language on the API components thinking
about how to do with that is the first situation

B.
Being able to change the languages should be easy

C.
I could voice out that we should've looked at which API's work best with
Swedish


what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A.
As stated before, we haven't really had much problems with using scrum, or 
if to be as brazen as to say any.

B.
I think we nailed it in the beginning and are on the "where we want to be"

C.
The way is already reached


what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A.
This week I made the language consistent on the site, as we have mixed both 
swedish and english. Ran in to problems that couldn't be solved

B.
Being able to change everything would've been a nice thing

C.
Things that could've avoided this problem would be to deciding which language
to use in the beginning and see if the API's we're going to use support the 
intended language
