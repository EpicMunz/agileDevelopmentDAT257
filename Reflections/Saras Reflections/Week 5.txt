what do I want to learn or understand better?
A. 
I'm still not that good at programming, which is what I want to improve, especially in a larger project. 

B.
The best would of course be to be able to independently find solutions.

C.
I think pairing up with someone who's better at it in the group would help a lot.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
A.
As of this week everyone has gotten into a pretty good work flow and I can't seem to figure about what to help
others learning something new. 

B.
I would love for the others to feel like I can be of help in learning something new.

C.
As I've mentioned before I would try to research with them and try to find materials.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
A.
I'm still not sure what to contribute to as we go through everything together and work with user stories.

B.
I guess be more open spoken about which user stories to work with.

C.
Think through after the meeting with PO about what kind of user stories would work best.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
A.
This week I contributed to the login page, though not very pretty but it works as it should. 

B.
I did get some help with it so try to follow how it helped me and try it out myself.

C.
Same there with trying to following how the helper did to remind myself of what to do.
